h2. Setting init state

When writing your scenario in i-score, you may want to set an init state for your whole devices setup ie. a default state before starting your performance.

Rather than adding an automation box with only a start or end event, you can store a single state at the beginning of the whole scenario. One must select the whole scenario and assign it a namespace selection. To do so, click on the scenario name ("New scenario" in the illustration below) and select the addresses in the device explorer.

When done, click the "start" checkbox. A dark shade is added at the beginning of the timeline, just like with any regular automation box.
