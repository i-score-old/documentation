title: Meeting i-score interface
---

This guide will walk you through the various component of i-score interface.

i-score interface is organized around two main parts: the Device Explorer, used to navigate and manage your distant application's parameters and the timeline where you create and organize your automations in time.

h3. Timeline

When starting a brand new project, i-score offers a blank score named by default "New Scenario". The name of the scenario is displayed in the timeline pane top bar. If you save your scenario on disk using <code>Save</code> from the <code>File</code> menu (cmd+s/ctl+s respectively on Mac and Windows), the name in the timeline pane top bar will be updated with the name of your scenario file.

The main area is where you create and organize various objects such as automations boxes along the indicative time rule at the top. 

Objects are created by dragging your mouse in the scenario while holding cmd/ctl (respectively on Mac and Window). See "Writing automation":writing-automations.html section for detailed explanations.

bq. Please note that as of version 0.2.2, i-score does not support copy, paste, duplicate, undo facilities. These features and related shortcuts will be available in future versions

This top bar also provides a transport section with the following controls:

!./images/timeline-play.png(i-score transport)! play/stop the execution of your scenario

!./images/timeline-rewind.png(i-score transport)! rewind to the start of your scenario

!./images/timeline-speed.png(i-score transport)! adjust speed of your scenario in real time

h3. Device explorer

The Device explorer allows to navigate through the various parameters of your distant application and select/unselect the parameter whose values to get stored in an object on the timeline.

The Device explorer pane can be hidden/displayed by toggling the Device explorer entry in the View menu (cmd+e/ctl+e respectively on Mac and Windows). It can also be moved in a seperate window by clicking the top-left button in i-score's main window. To attach it back to i-score main window, slide the Device explorer window to the left or right side of the timeline pane.

h4. Basic components

The Device explorer displays a structured list of all parameters of a distant application loaded as an i-score device (See "Using i-score with osc applications":./i-score-and-osc.html and "Using i-score with Minuit applications":./i-score-and-minuit.html for detailed explanations).

Each node in a parameter address is displayed as a name and a grey arrow. This arrow lets you expand/collapse the various levels or your application parameters. In the illustration below, we can see that the OSCdevice has the following parameters:

bq. /parent/topParameter.1
/parent/topParameter.2
/parent/child.1/myParameter
/parent/child.1/anotherParameter
/parent/child.2/myParameter
/parent/child.2/anotherParameter

!./images/nodes.png(Structured list of parameters)!

Each parameter can be of 3 different access mode:

- bidirectionnal: a distant application's parameter can be set and get from i-score
- receiver: a distant application's parameter can be set from i-score
- sender: a distant application's parameter can be get form i-score

Note that in the Device explorer pane, receivers and senders are respectively displayed as light grey italic text and black italic text.

<!-- For example, in the illustration below, the preset address under the audio node of the mediaPlayer device is a method allowing to recall a preset setting, while audio/track.1/input/soundfile/report is a message sent from the distant application when the sounfile being played reaches its end. -->
The Device explorer pane provides two columns named "Start" and "End". For each parameter of the device, these columns display start and end values of an automation box. A double-click in the cell brings a textfield allowing to manually set start and/or end value.

Both Start and End columns are precedeed by a column named "v" containing checkboxes. These allow to set whether a parameter value will be respectively stored as a box's start or end.

Finally, the column named "~" is use to set whether i-score will draw an interpolation between start and end values of an automation box.

h4. Managing parameters tree

Navigating through a great number of parameters can be tedious, hence the Device Explorer relies on multiple hierarchical selection/unselection.

When selecting a node in the tree of parameters, all nodes and parameters below that level will be automatically selected. For example, using the parameter addresses given above, selecting the node named @child.1@ will automatically select @/parent/child.1/myParameter@ as well as @/parent/child.1/anotherParameter@. Now if you check the start or end checkbox, all selected addresses' checkbox will be check as well. This makes it much easier to store a bunch of parameters' value in an event as illustrated below.

h4. Advanced settings

Some additionnal settings can be accessed by widening the Device explorer pane (when the Device explorer pane is attached to i-score main window, grab its right border and slide it to the right).

!./images/deviceexplorer-column.png(Device explorer advanced settings)!

The first column named "=" sets whether repeted values will get filtered out (default) when playing an automation.

Column named "%" allows to define the rate at which values will get sent by i-score. Time between two values is given as milliseconds.

"Access" column displays a symbol depending on the access mode of the parameter: bidirectionnal (@<->@), receiver (@->@) or sender (@<-@).

Finally, "min" and "max" column display some optional minimum and maximum values for the parameter, as optionally defined in the xml file describing the parameters structure of your device (ie. for OSC devices) or as queried by i-score (ie. for Minuit devices).
