When working on a large project, there may be a point where setting intervals between a number of automation boxes can be tedious when adjusting your scenario. For example, when writting the scenario of a whole live performance, you will most likely have a number of automations written through the various scene of your scenario. Thus you may want to group automations belonging to a particular scene so you can manage them as a whole. Hence i-score let you write sub-scenarios in a given box.

bq. As of version 0.2.2 sub-scenario offer the same set of features as working in the main timeline. However, upcoming versions of i-score will bring some advanced features to sub-scenario such as the ability to loop sub-scenarios.

In order to start working on a sub-scenario, you first need to create a regular automation box. Then from its top-bar menu, select "Scenario".

You can then create somes boxes using cmd+drag or ctl+drag respectively on Mac and Windows and feed them some content as explained in "previous tutorials":./writing-automations.html.

All boxes created in a sub-scenario depend on the box that contains them. Hence, note that when moving the parent box along the timeline, all boxes in the sub-scenario are moved accordingly.
