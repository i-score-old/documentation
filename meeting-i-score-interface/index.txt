This guide will walk you through the various component of i-score interface.

The interface is made around two main parts: the Device Explorer, used to manage your distant application's parameters and the timeline where you will create and organize your temporal objects in time.

h3. Timeline

When starting a brand new project, i-score offers a blank score named by default "New Scenario". The name of the scenario is displayed in the timeline pane top bar. If you save your scenario on disk using <code>Save</code> from the <code>File</code> menu (cmd+s/ctl+s respectively on Mac and Windows), the name in the timeline pane top bar will be updated with the name of your scenario file.

The main area is where you will create and organize temporal objects such as automations along the indicative time rule at the top. 

bq. Since i-score allows to interactively trigger events, keep in mind that this time rule may not reflect real time as your scenario is executed. 

Objects are created by dragging your mouse in the scenario while holding cmd/ctl (respectively on Mac and Window). See "Writing automation":writing-automations.html section for detailed explanations.

This top bar also provides a transport section with the following controls:

!./images/timeline-play.png(i-score transport)! play/stop the execution of your scenario

!./images/timeline-rewind(i-score transport)! rewind to the start of your scenario

!./images/timeline-speed(i-score transport)! live speed adjustment of your scenario execution

h3. Device explorer

The Device explorer allows to navigate through the various parameters of your distant application and select/unselect the parameter whose values will be stored in an object on the timeline.

The Device explorer pane can be hidden/displayed by toggling the Device explorer entry in the View menu (cmd+e/ctl+e respectively on Mac and Windows). It can also be moved in a seperate window by clicking the top-left button in i-score's main window. To attach it back to i-score main window, slide the Device explorer window to the left or right side of the timeline pane.

h4. Basic components (exploring your application ?)

The Device explorer displays a structured list of all parameters of a distant application loaded as an i-score device (See "Using i-score with osc applications":./i-score-and-osc.html and "Using i-score with Minuit applications":./i-score-and-minuit.html for detailed explanations).
