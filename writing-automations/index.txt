In this tutorial, we will see how to create events and automations in i-score. Assuming you have already "set up some devices":http://i-score.org/documentation/iscore-and-minuit in i-score Device explorer, you are now ready to start writing your own scenario. Here we will use i-score to control a Max patch built using the "Jamoma":http://jamoma.org/download/0.6 framework through the Minuit protocol, as set tup in the "Minuit setup tutorial page":http://i-score.org/documentation/iscore-and-minuit. You can find this patch from the Examples folder. In order to get this example work, be sure to setup your device as explained in the Minuit tutorial and set @mediaPlayer@ as the name of your device.

In the timeline panel, draw an empty box using cmd+drag (on Mac) or ctrl-drag (on Win and Linux). 

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/drawing-box.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/drawing-box-detail-300x186.png" alt="drawing box-detail" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-533" /></a>

When done, you can freely move the box in i-score's timeline and adjust its start time and duration. For example, we will want our box to start playing at 0 min 1 sec. and stop at 0 min. 5 sec. You can move the box by clicking its top bar and adjust its duration by dragging its lower right corner as shown below.


<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ajusting-start-point.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/asjusting-start-point-detail-300x249.png" alt="asjusting start point-detail" width="300" height="249" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-532" /></a>

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adjusting-size-box.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adjusting-size-box-detail1-300x205.png" alt="adjusting size box-detail" width="300" height="205" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-537" /></a>

h4. Automatic content addition

Here we will want to use this box to control a simple gain fade-in for the soundfile player in the first audio track of our Max patch. 

Select our box called <code>Box.2</code>. It should be highlighted by a blue shadow-like. 

Then from the Device explorer panel, deploy the various nodes of our Patch namespace until you reach the following address:

<code>mediaPlayer/audio/track.1/input/audio/gain</code>

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selecting-parameters.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selecting-parameters-detail-275x300.png" alt="selecting parameters-detail" width="275" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-535" /></a>

You can then click the checkbox beside our gain parameter to store its current value at the box's start event. You can see that our parameter value was automatically grabbed from our Max patch and is displayed in the field next the checkbox. Moreover, this new content is symbolized in the box by a grey shade at the box side.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-start-point.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-start-point-detail.png" alt="adding start point" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-528" /></a>

From the Max patch GUI, set the Master gain slider of the input module to 100, then store that value at the end event of <code>Box.2</code>. From i-score's Device explorer, click the end checkbox next to our gain parameter. Again, the value we just stored is displayed in the textfield beside the checkbox and as a shade of grey at the box's right side.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-end-point.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-end-point-detail-300x146.png" alt="adding end point-detail" width="300" height="146" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-525" /></a>

If you play our scenario, you should see the GUI being updated as i-score goes through the automation in the box.

<blockquote class="tip">Note that boxes can be played individually by clicking the play button in the box top-bar. This can be useful if you want to quickly check the automation you just wrote.</blockquote>

You can now add more content to this box by selecting other parameters from the Device explorer and checking the start and end event boxes. Note that you can "select a group of parameters in a single click":http://i-score.org/documentation/meeting-i-score-interface.

<blockquote class="tip">
If you want to remove some parameters from a box, select the parameter in the Device explorer and toggle off the checkbox or press the backspace key.
</blockquote>

h3. Manually adding content

When checking a start or end event box, i-score automatically grabs the parameter's current value. This is really convenient as it allows to adjust the various parameters of your distant application live and then make a snapshot of its current state. However, this assumes a bi-directionnal communication between i-score and your controlled application. 

When controlling applications that can only receive parameter's value, we can however manually set some values in our box.

As an example, we will manually add some automation values for the pan value of our audio track 1.

Once having created a box as explained above, browse the Device explorer until you reach the following address:

<code>/mediaPlayer/audio/track.1/input/balance/position</code>

Rather than checking the start and end boxes, we will enter some values in the dedicated fields as shown below.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/manually-setting-values.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/manually-setting-values-detail-300x123.png" alt="manually setting values-detail" width="300" height="123" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-563" /></a>

h3. Recording automations

i-score allows to record incoming parameter's value into automation box. To do so, once selected the automation box to store value recording, navigate to the desired parameter address in the Device explorer and click on the interpolation check box while holding the cmd/ctl key down, respectively on Mac and Windows. You will see that the check box turned into a "recording" icon and the selected automation box is highlited in red. Now if you start playing your scenario, all incoming values as the box get played will be recorded as an automation.

Note that you may arm recording for many parameters at once.

h3. Editing automations

When setting a parameter's start and end value in a box, i-score will automatically create an interpolation bewteen the two defined values. Of course, you can edit this default interpolation and further refine your automation.

From the box top-bar, select the parameter interpolation you want to edit from the drop-down menu. The interpolation function is now displayed at the box foreground.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/editing-interpolation.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/editing-interpolation-detail-300x150.png" alt="editing interpolation-detail" width="300" height="150" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-557" /></a>

h4. Break Point Function editing

Points can be added to the default function by clicking in the box. Note that you can delete existing point by alt-clicking a point.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/drawing-bpf.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/drawing-bpf-detail-300x212.png" alt="drawing bpf-detail" width="300" height="212" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-559" /></a>

You can also add to each segment of the break point function a curve factor. For this, shift+click on a point and drag your mouse upward ou downward.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/curve-factor.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/curve-factor-detail-300x212.png" alt="curve factor-detail" width="300" height="212" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-561" /></a>

h4. Free curve drawing

You can also write a custom interpolation curve by drawing inthe automation box. When having selected the parameter interpolation to edit as explained above, hold down the cmd/ctl key (respectively on Mac and Windows) and drag your mouse in the automation box. As you hover the box while holding the cmd/ctl key down, you will notice that the mouse cursor changes into a pen. You can now draw a curve as desired.

You are now ready to write some nice automations to control your favorite applications !
