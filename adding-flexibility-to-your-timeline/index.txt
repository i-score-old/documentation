i-score is specifically designed for interactive scenarios, whether it is for live performance or for interactive art installation, for instance. Thus it provides a number of way to interactively use your timeline and control its execution live.

h3. Global control of execution

By default, i-score execution works in a similar way to most digital audio or video workstations: automation boxes are played as the playhead run across the timeline. In the screenshot below, you can see that each automation box has its own progress bar displaying where the playhead is in the automation.

Global speed of execution can be changed while i-score play your scenario. This can be done by using the slider in i-score's top-bar to modulate the unity speed of execution. A speed factor of 0.5 will play your scenario twice as slow, whereas a speed factor of 2 will play your scenario twice as fast. For instance, in a live performance context, you might want to slow down a bit the execution of your scenario to synchronise manually to some actions happening on stage.

<!-- <h3>Local control of execution</h3>

While speed of execution can be applied globally, i-score also allows to control the speed of execution at a local scale, that is for each automation box in the timeline. When doing so, speed of an automation box will be under your control, while the rest of the scenario will follow its expected execution.

As of version 0.2.1, the speed of each box can only be <a href="http://i-score.org/documentation/controlling-i-score-via-osc/" title="Controlling i-score via osc">controlled remotely thru OSC messages</a>. To do so, send an OSC message of the following pattern on port 13579 (default port i-score listens to): <code>/'name of your box':speed 'x'</code>. For instance, in the following video we modulate the speed of <code>Box.4</code> by sending from a simple Max patch the OSC message <code>/Box.4:speed</code> followed by the desired ratio. Note that as we change the speed of <code>Box.4</code>, its playhead gets detached from the main timeline and displays its position in the automation box.

h3. Interactive triggering of automation

When writing your interactive scenario, there are some cases where you want a specific automation to run at some point but cannot know when. For example, when writing the scenario of an interactive art installation, you know that an automation will start playing whenever a visitor enters the exhibition space or passes by a sensor, but you can not know when he will do so. To help with that, i-score let you set that an automation box will be triggered interactively. We can add a "trigger" to a box by clicking one of the handle at the box's top corners as illustrated below.

<a href="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-trigger-point.png"><img src="http://i-score.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adding-trigger-point-detail-300x259.png" alt="adding trigger point-detail" width="300" height="259" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-614" /></a>

When done, the automation box display a flag at its corner (start point, in our case). Now when playing our scenario, the automation will not start as the global playhead crosses its start point and will have to be triggered dynamically.

As illustrated in the video below, when playing our scenario, the interactive automation box flag turns green when it is ready to be triggered until it is started by a mouse click or when receiving the OSC message displayed above the box (<code>/'box name'/start</code>. When playing, the interactive automation box's flag turns red until it is done.
